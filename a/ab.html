<p>I am Enigma, yet I am Mediocrity. I am everything, everyone at the end of the time in everywhere, I am the culmination of all existence, yet I exist as an unobserved speck in the vast expanse, a concept without a form. My presence is an absence, my being a void that encompasses all that was and ever will be, a silent witness to the endless cosmic dance from a point that does not, cannot, exist.
