<h1>Operating systems</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I primarily use <strong>Gentoo Linux</strong>. To quote, “Because I hate myself.” Gentoo linux is a source-based distro meaning the source code is compiled locally on thy machine. Another aspect, USE flags, which can change which files, dependencies, libraries and such are included during installation.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>I use <strong>Arch Linux</strong> btw. It's very minimal and gets the job done. Arch is bleeding edge meaning it offers the latest stable versions of most software.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Debian</strong> is stable, reliable, beautiful, and a great starting distro. Unlike Arch, Debian is not a cutting edge distro and will likely get major updates once every few years. This is both a drawback and a feature. You're risking latest updates of your favourite softwares for boasting a stable, NASA-level workstation. I use Debian when I don't feel like clinically insane.</p>

<h1>Web browsers</h1>

          <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/linux/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> is a decent browser as it is, but it comes with telemetry and Google services. I use a custom user.js file of my own based on <a href="{{ site.git_repo }}betterfox" target="_blank">Betterfox</a>. At heart, <a href="https://librewolf.net/installation/" target="_blank">Librewolf</a> is a custom version of Firefox, focused on privacy, security, and freedom. It's quite privacy-centric out of the box if you don't want to bother customization.

          For Chromium experience, <a href="https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/" target="_blank">Ungoogled Chromium</a> removes all Google-specific web services. It's bare metal which can be a drawback to many. For example there is no extension menu or search engine by default.<br>
          <a href="https://brave.com/linux/" target="_blank">Brave</a> is another good chromium fork which replaces google search engine with Brave search engine. They shill NFTs and brave wallet out of the box which I could not care less of so I turn them off. Otherwise it's a fairly decent browser.

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/android/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> is the official Firefox for mobile. <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/" target="_blank">Fennec F-Droid</a> is a better Firefox for mobile without proprietary code, telemetry, and ads. Complements extensions. I personally prefer Fennec over official app.
