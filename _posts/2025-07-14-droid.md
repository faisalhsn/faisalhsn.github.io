## State of Android

We're witnessing the enshittification of the Android operating system. Every major contender in the market is trying way too hard to be iPhone, and in doing so, they've directly or indirectly contributed to the erosion of what Android was meant to be. If you were not aware: Android is based on Linux. And Linux stands for user freedom, privacy, and, of course, customizability. By dismantling user freedom, companies are spitting in the face of what it was built on.


Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Huawei etc companies are adopting apple-like behaviors: Batshit heavy UI skins, bloatware, making software updates more restrictive and tighter integration with proprietary services. 

More and more companies now follow the trend of locking the bootloader, and many outright refuse to provide unlock codes. Unlocking the bootloader is a crucial first step toward gaining root access, the very thing that gives users full control over their device. So, naturally, by locking that door, they're restricting root access altogether. Some devices ironically, like Google’s own Pixel line still allow it. But most don't.

If you seek even some degree of privacy, best you can do is "De-google" or more specifically "De-bloat" your android system. And replace google services with FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)(Free as in freedom, not as in free shwarma). 

Years back, [I wrote a custom shell script to remove a ton of bloatware, spyware, and crapware from my Huawei device](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nshfm/fb3e3eb49dffe05ef7537046c86eccc8/raw/7f7651417bf61593b9cde8a793121399be1ae938/android_debloat.sh). This included almost everything Google except for **Google’s installer**. (Do **not** remove that. You’ll need it for sideloading apps)


## De-Bloat 

In this guide, I’ll show you how to efficiently debloat your Android device without root access.

But before removing any core Google services, make sure you’ve already replaced them with FOSS alternatives or you might end up breaking functionality.

For example:
Replace Google Play Store with Aurora Store and F-Droid. Replace Chrome with Firefox.

<div class="warning">
  <strong>⚠ WARNING</strong><br><br>
  This script uninstalls system apps for the current user (<code>User 0</code>). Some removals may break functionality or cause instability depending on your ROM or device and may even brick it.<br><br>
  If things go south, your only real fallback is a full factory reset. This should return the phone to its stock state and (hopefully) restore removed system apps.<br><br>

**Step 0:** Install adb 

This guide will assume you are on any linux distro. Go to Step 1 if you have adb installed.

```
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install adb

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S android-tools

# Other distros
sudo <package_manager> <install_flag> adb

```

**Step 1:** Configure adb

In your phone, turn on usb debugging from developer mode. Then check if adb has detected your device <code>adb devices</code>

If your device is listed, you're good to go.

**Step 2:** Create a file with .sh extension for example: debloat.sh <code>touch debloat.sh</code> and Give it executable permission  <code>chmod +x debloat.sh</code>

**Step 3:** Copy following content inside it.

```
#!/bin/bash

# Remove packages

packages=(


# This is an Example list. 
# Always search "safe bloatware list for [your phone model]"
# These are for my Huawei device, but your mileage may vary.


  "com.google.android.gms"
  "com.huawei.android.totemweather"
  "com.netflix.partner.activation"
  "com.netflix.mediaclient"
)

for package in "${packages[@]}"; do
  echo "Removing $package..."
  adb uninstall --user 0 $package
done


# Clear package data

for package in "${packages[@]}"; do
  echo "Clearing data for $package..."
  adb shell pm clear $package
  
# Clearing data is optional, you may remove this from the script.
done
```


**Step 4:** Heed absolute caution and run the script <code>./debloat.sh</code>

**Step:** Restart your device <code>adb reboot</code>

Congratulations! You have successfully De-Bloated your device.
